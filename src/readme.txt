For our project we were looking at election results from 2000-2016 on the county level to observe which counties more commonly flipped between democrat and republican from election to election. We chose a map as our visual encoding for this project. While we are aware of the deficiencies of maps as visual encodings as they are good at representing area but bad at representing population, we still elected to use a map because it is such a common visual encoding for showing election results and most people who follow elections are used to looking at this encoding. Other possible visual encodings would have suffered similar issues of not properly representing the overall population because some counties are more densely populated than others, so in the absence of a better alternative we went with the standard visual encoding for displaying such results.

In developing this encoding, we first chose a question that we wanted to explore. We then split up and searched for data sources to answer this question, and created independent designs for our encoding. In the end, we selected Robel's choice of dataset, with Kyle finding the same data with more years to observe, and we selected Kyle's design for the encoding. Robel had the most experience in the group with HTML/CSS/JavaScript, so he took the lead with coding up the project, with Joely coding up the time slider and providing support with cleaning the data and adding aggregations/etc to support our visual encoding. Kyle did the write-up for the project.  

The bulk of the time was spent on the actual coding of the project, particularly on mapping datapoints in our csv to datapoints in the geojson file we used to do the mapping. We had some problems with mapping Alaska, as they reported their election results by district rather than by county. We elected to only show the results for those counties that reported and will look for ways to either change the data to report by zip code or to change the mapping of Alaska to show by district. The total of approximately 24 people-hours was spent on this project.
